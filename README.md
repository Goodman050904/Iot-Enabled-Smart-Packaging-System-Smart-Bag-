Iot Enabled Smart Packaging System using ESP32

🚀 Also Applicable as a Smart Bag for Travel and Safety

 Overview
This project is an IoT-based Smart Packaging System built using an ESP32 microcontroller that continuously monitors a package’s condition during transit. It can also be used as a Smart Bag for travelers or professionals who want real-time security, location tracking, and environment monitoring of their belongings.

 Key Features
 
📍 GPS Tracking – Real-time location monitoring using the Neo-6M GPS module

📦 Motion & Vibration Detection – Monitors package tampering using MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope)

🌡️ Environment Sensing – Detects temperature and pressure using BMP280

🧪 Gas & Smoke Detection – Alerts for dangerous gases using MQ2 sensor

💡 Open/Close Detection – LDR sensor to detect if the package/bag is opened

🔔 Alert System – Buzzer alert controlled via Blynk app

🪪 Item Tracking – RFID-based content tracking for items placed inside

📲 IoT Integration – Live data monitoring on Blynk IoT Dashboard

 Use Cases
Smart Package: For logistics, ensuring safety during shipment

Smart Bag: For travelers or students to track, secure, and monitor bag contents
